	abstract = {We present a novel algorithm to detect double nuclei galaxies (DNG) called GOTHIC (Graph BOosted iterated HIll Climbing) - that detects whether a given image of a galaxy has two or more closely separated nuclei. Our aim is to detect samples of dual or multiple active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies. Although galaxy mergers are common, the detection of dual AGN is rare. Their detection is very important as they help us understand the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, SMBH growth and AGN feedback effects in multiple nuclei systems. There is thus a need for an algorithm to do a systematic survey of existing imaging data for the discovery of DNGs and dual AGN. We have tested GOTHIC on a known sample of DNGs and subsequently applied it to a sample of a million SDSS DR16 galaxies lying in the redshift range of 0 to 0.75 approximately, and have available spectroscopic data. We have detected 159 dual AGN in this sample, of which 2 are triple AGN systems. Our results show that dual AGN are not common, and triple AGN even rarer. The color (u-r) magnitude plots of the DNGs indicate that star formation is quenched as the nuclei come closer and as the AGN fraction increases. The quenching is especially prominent for dual/triple AGN galaxies that lie in the extreme end of the red sequence.},

	abstract = {Recent self-supervised methods for image representation learning are based on maximizing the agreement between embedding vectors from different views of the same image. A trivial solution is obtained when the encoder outputs constant vectors. This collapse problem is often avoided through implicit biases in the learning architecture, that often lack a clear justification or interpretation. In this paper, we introduce VICReg (Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization), a method that explicitly avoids the collapse problem with a simple regularization term on the variance of the embeddings along each dimension individually. VICReg combines the variance term with a decorrelation mechanism based on redundancy reduction and covariance regularization, and achieves results on par with the state of the art on several downstream tasks. In addition, we show that incorporating our new variance term into other methods helps stabilize the training and leads to performance improvements.},

	abstract = {Sky surveys are the largest data generators in astronomy, making automated tools for extracting meaningful scientific information an absolute necessity. We show that, without the need for labels, self-supervised learning recovers representations of sky survey images that are semantically useful for a variety of scientific tasks. These representations can be directly used as features, or fine-tuned, to outperform supervised methods trained only on labeled data. We apply a contrastive learning framework on multi-band galaxy photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to learn image representations. We then use them for galaxy morphology classification, and fine-tune them for photometric redshift estimation, using labels from the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset and SDSS spectroscopy. In both downstream tasks, using the same learned representations, we outperform the supervised state-of-the-art results, and we show that our approach can achieve the accuracy of supervised models while using 2-4 times fewer labels for training.},

	abstract = {During galaxy mergers, gas and dust are driven toward the centers of merging galaxies, triggering enhanced star formation and supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. Theory predicts that this heightened activity peaks at SMBH separations {\textless}20 kpc; if sufficient material accretes onto one or both of the SMBHs for them to become observable as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during this phase, they are known as offset and dual AGNs, respectively. To better study these systems, we have built the ACS-AGN Merger Catalog, a large catalog (N = 204) of uniformly selected offset and dual AGN observed by the Hubble Space Telescope at 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 with separations {\textless}20 kpc. Using this catalog, we answer many questions regarding SMBH−galaxy coevolution during mergers. First, we confirm predictions that the AGN fraction peaks at SMBH pair separations {\textless}10 kpc; specifically, we find that the fraction increases significantly at pair separations of {\textless}4 kpc. Second, we find that AGNs in mergers are preferentially found in major mergers and that the fraction of AGNs found in mergers follows a logarithmic relation, decreasing as merger mass ratio increases. Third, we do not find that mergers (nor the major or minor merger subpopulations) trigger the most luminous AGNs. Finally, we find that nuclear column density, AGN luminosity, and host galaxy star formation rate have no dependence on SMBH pair separation or merger mass ratio in these systems, nor do the distributions of these values differ significantly from that of the overall AGN population.},

	abstract = {Binary or dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) are expected from galaxy formation theories. However, confirmed DAGN are rare and finding these systems has proved to be challenging. Recent systematic searches for DAGN using double-peaked emission lines have yielded several new detections, as have the studies of samples of merging galaxies. In this paper, we present an updated list of DAGN compiled from published data. We also present preliminary results from our ongoing Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA) radio study of eight double-peaked emission-line AGN (DPAGN). One of the sample galaxy shows an S-shaped radio jet. Using new and archival data, we have successfully fitted a precessing jet model to this radio source. We find that the jet precession could be due to a binary AGN with a super-massive black-hole (SMBH) separation of ∼ 0.02 pc or a single AGN with a tilted accretion disk. We have found that another sample galaxy, which is undergoing a merger, has two radio cores with a projected separation of 5.6 kpc. We discuss the preliminary results from our radio study.},

	abstract = {We review accretion mechanisms for powering the central engines of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and possible sources of fuel. Local sources, such as dense star clusters, require extreme set of parameters. Instead we argue that the interstellar matter in the main body of the host galaxy is channelled towards the centre and address the problem of angular momentum transport. Thin accretion disks are not a viable means of delivering fuel to luminous AGN on scales much larger than a parsec because of the long inflow time and effects of self-gravity. There are also serious obstacles to maintaining and regulating geometrically thick, hot accretion flows. We emphasize the role of non-axisymmetric perturbations of the gravitational potential on galactic scales and their triggers: galaxy interactions and internal self-gravitational instabilities. We outline a unified model for fuelling AGN, in which the inflow on large scales is driven by gravitational torques, and on small scales forms a mildly self-gravitating disk of clouds with inflow driven by magnetic torques or cloud–cloud collisions.},

	abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to investigate how the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of massive galaxies (M* \&gt; 1010 M⊙) depend on the distance to their closest companions. We estimate sSFR enhancements by comparing with control samples that are matched in redshift, stellar mass, local density, and isolation, and we restrict our analysis to pairs with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 to 10. At small separations (∼15 kpc), the mean sSFR is enhanced by a factor of 2.0 ± 0.1 in the flagship (110.7 Mpc)3 simulation (TNG100-1). Statistically significant enhancements extend out to 3D separations of 280 kpc in the (302.6 Mpc)3 simulation (TNG300-1). We find similar trends in the EAGLE and Illustris simulations, although their sSFR enhancements are lower than those in TNG100-1 by about a factor of two. Enhancements in IllustrisTNG galaxies are seen throughout the redshift range explored (0 ≤ \$z\$ \&lt; 1), with the strength of the enhancements decreasing with increasing redshift for galaxies with close companions. In order to more closely compare with observational results, we separately consider 2D projected distances between galaxies in IllustrisTNG. We detect significant sSFR enhancements out to projected separations of 260 kpc in TNG300-1, with projection effects diluting the size of the enhancements by about 20 per cent below 50 kpc. We find similar sSFR enhancements in TNG100-1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, with enhancements extending out to projected separations of about 150 kpc for star-forming galaxies at \$z\$ \&lt; 0.2. Finally, by summing over all separations, we estimate that the presence of closest companions boosts the average sSFR of massive galaxies in TNG100-1 by 14.5 per cent.},
